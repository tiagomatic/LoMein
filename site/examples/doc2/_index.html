<p>It can be confusing to find your tag firing when you are using Signal. You will need to use HTTP monitoring tools. There are several that are available for free in each browser.</p>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li>There is a tool in Firefox called <a href="https://getfirebug.com/"><span class="s1">Firebug</span></a>.</li>
	<li>The Safari developer tool is called Web Inspector.</li>
	<li>There is a stand-alone application called Charles.</li>
	<li>In Chrome, you can use the Signal extension, <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1153136-installing-brighttag-inspector">Tag Inspector</a>.</li>
	<li>There are several versions of developer tools in the different versions of Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Safari, the developer tools are not automatically visible. You must open Safari, and click Preferences.</p>

<p>Once you have the tools loaded, you will be able to see tags fire, both in <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1254637-how-to-preview-tags">Preview</a> and in real time. When the Preference menu comes up, make sure the box for Show Develop menu in menu bar is checked.</p>

<p>When it is, you will see the Develop option in your browser at the top rail.</p>

<p>Once the Develop Tools are loaded in the Safari Browser, go to the website you are working with, and click Develop, and then Show Web Inspector.</p>

<p>Select Timelines from the Navigation bar within the inspector. It will be blank at first.</p>

<p>You will need to reload your page, or click on an element within the page to see the tag fire. In this example we are looking for a Google Analytics tag. It is assumed that you know what your tag looks like, so you can find it within the timeline.</p>

<p>Here is the Google Analytics tag, which is highlighted in blue, and you can see it is firing after or below the tag.js (which is the Signal tag).</p>
