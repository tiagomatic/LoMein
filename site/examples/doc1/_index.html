<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>These instructions are for setting up a web Channel in Signal Fuse Data Hub.</p>

<p>When logging into Signal for the first time, you will be prompted to set up your code snippet in your website. The code snippet must be added to each page of your website. This code allows Signal to manage data collection and distribution on your site based on the rules you will provide in the system. Because Signal&#39;s server dynamically determines which tags will fire on each page, the Signal code placed on every page of your site will be the exact same snippet.</p>

<p>Because Signal knows when you have implemented the code snippet on your site, you will be able to start seeing page views. Once you have copied the code snippet onto each page (preferably the footer of each page) of your website, you can click the Start Adding Tags button, and add your first tag!</p>

<h2>Next: Add a Tag</h2>

<p>Click the Start Adding Integrations button at the bottom of the page and you will be brought to the Signal Catalog which includes tags from our <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1300337-brighttag-certified-partner-program">Certified Partners</a> and more.</p>

<p>Use the search bar at the top left to find the tag you want to add. It is recommended that your first tag solely use static data &rsaquo;values (like User IDs) instead of dynamic data values (like shopping cart total) since those require the setup of <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/831835-adding-a-data-element"><span class="s1">Data Elements</span>.</a></p>

<p>In this example, we are adding a DoubleClick Floodlight/Spotlight (Pixel) tag. Add the tag&rsquo;s name, any comments to orient you later, and the required fields of Source ID, Type, and Category. Information boxes will come up on the right side when you are filling in the fields explaining more about what information is required. The fields of Order ID and Custom Data are not required but the information box on the right explains why you might need to populate these fields.</p>

<p>Once you click Create Integration, you will be asked to assign that tag to a source (aka a Page). A tag will only fire on its assigned Page(s).</p>

<p>If your tag should fire on every single page of your website, you can easily assign the tag to &ldquo;All Pages&rdquo;. Simply click the Unassigned tab and it will switch to Assigned. Then click Save &amp; Continue. &nbsp;Signal automatically creates an &ldquo;All Pages&rdquo; Page for you representing every URL of your website. The ** added into the URL field in Signal is a wildcard that represents everything in that URL of your website. To read more about the wildcard concept and usage, <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/854568-page-patterns-brighttag-wildcards">click here</a>.</p>

<p>You have now assigned that tag to those pages.</p>

<h2>Optional: Add a Source</h2>

<p>If you want to assign this tag to a specific page or range of pages, then you will need to add a new Page by clicking on the &ldquo;Add and assign a new Source&rdquo; link underneath the Sources table.</p>

<p>When adding your page name, be sure to note the Naming Guide shown on the right. You can also refer to this article on <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/867182-pages-tour"><span class="s1">page setup</span></a> for some tips on naming conventions.</p>

<p>When the Page Name is added, add the URL pattern. Note the URL Pattern explanation on the right side when that field is selected. The information in that panel can be expanded to show more. Additionally, to learn more about URLs and page patterns, you can read <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/832244-url-pattern-includes-excludes">this article</a></p>

<p>After adding your URL pattern, include any comments to help orient later you to this page, and either click Save and Assign Page or Save and Assign Another if you have another page to add. You will be brought back to the Tag Assignment page where your newly created Page will already be assigned. Assign additional pages to the Tag if necessary or click Save &amp; Continue where you will be taken to the Tag&rsquo;s Statistics Overview page.</p>

<h2>Next: Preview Tag</h2>

<p>When the tag is created and assigned, it will automatically go into Preview mode. It is important to test your tag in Preview to make sure it is set up correctly and behaves the way you wish it to. You can click on the Next step link in the yellow bar at the top of the page to learn how to Preview your tag.</p>

<p>Preview allows users to test tags in a production environment. Tags can be tested in Chrome using the<a href="http://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1153136-brighttag-inspector"><span class="s1"> Inspector</span></a>, a Chrome extension. To learn more about Preview mode and how to test and preview tags, <a href="https://brighttag.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1254637-how-to-preview-tags"><span class="s2">read this article</span></a>.</p>

<p>Once you have tested your tag is set up correctly and you are ready to make it live, you will need to click on the Preview tab and move the tag into Active mode before it will fire.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! </strong>You have successfully completed the set-up process!</p>
